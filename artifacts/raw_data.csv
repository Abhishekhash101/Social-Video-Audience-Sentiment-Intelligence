@MasterLink1188,"Not even half the video and I already found MANY problems....

Infected 
Twice 1.3-1.5 faster than boat.
Inmune to physical dmg unless with weapon or tool crit.
Food saturation is reduce by half.
Food must work like armor - full food +5 protection, 1 or 0 food +0 protection - cant die of starvation, if starved speed is normal on water, halved on ground.
Weak against fire weapons but do triple dmg if burning.

Humans
Get hurt easier - if no armor receive triple dmg, all sources - leather recieve double dmg, coopper normal dmg, iron works normal and so on.
Hunger works 0.5 faster - pork, lamb, beef equal saturation - fish & everything else saturation is halved their normal.
Water speed is halved - boats works normal.

All villages are infected.
Zombies poison and skeletons cant die under the sun.
Posion spider only.
Mob respawn normal.

Even if the dragon hadn't killed Sapnap, I think there might have been JUST enough time for Dream to take one swing at Sapnap and get him.

Honestly, it was do or die there; the dragon might hit Sapnap and kill him (KB from the wings ig?), but if he stops to eat, he's almost definitely dead anyway since Dream was right on his tail 😅",2026-02-04T12:51:05Z,0

@petersmythe6462,"I have played this before. Some Manhunt servers literally default to it to avoid player elimination. The important thing is that at least one runner needs to make rapid progress and the runners should stay together. Otherwise it can quickly become a manhunt vs 4 hunters which only the best players can do (and if the best player dies early, it becomes extremely dangerous as now it's a manhunt but one of the hunters is better than the runners).",2026-02-04T10:58:32Z,0

I was expecting to see cool traps and assassination attempts to try and kill someone rather then just the same cheap tactic. If yall do this again, BAN bed bombing, but make the hunter at the start spawn with more hp or somthing to get rid of the skill gap between the players.
