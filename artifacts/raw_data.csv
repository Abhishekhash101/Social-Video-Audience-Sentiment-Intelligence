@BlitzIn4,"23:56 He is incorrect. When the moving scrollable content is moving up, you are scrolling down. He could be scrolling right on his screen and if the content is disappearing at the top and new content is appearing at the bottom, he would then be scrolling down, not scrolling right. In the future when we are all using Google Lens and we don't use touch screens but instead use our eyes to move down a page, are we to call it 'look down' to scroll down the page? No, it will still be called scroll down. What about people who use Google Lens and people who use smart phones and people who use a playstation controller, they need the same terminology to communicate with each other. There is only one correct term. It is scroll down.",2019-12-09T02:32:32Z,1

@peoplepower7007,"Why is Google Blocking Privacy Browsers
Epic Privacy Browser  vs GOOGLE
Epic Privacy Browser is the best (Privacy Browser) out there.
I dont like being tracked.
What I do on line is my business. If I wanted my info to be past around the GLOB I can do that myself.
I want to be PRIVET, This is why I don't use Face Book.
The thing with YouTube is when your on here for 30 minuts you will get 30 to 40 Trackes/COOKIES loaded onto your PC/LapTop/phone. With EPIC you can see them being LOCKED. Use epic it will keep you Privet on every page you Visit
Epice vs Google. The thing is Google make BIG money from us all, Selling the internet to us/phoneLine & Adds. So why it it so expensive. Google is now making $3 billion a month in advertising alone. 
Internet Users European Union, 31,21,515,71 - China, 3,840,000,00 - United States, 266,441,302, 3, 84 - India, 352,340,854, 2, 24 = 622937454179 people on a databass. We as people are powerful. We must stop being use by ""giant companies""
